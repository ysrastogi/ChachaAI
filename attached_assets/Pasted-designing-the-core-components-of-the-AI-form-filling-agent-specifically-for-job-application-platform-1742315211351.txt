designing the core components of the AI form-filling agent specifically for job application platforms like Workday. Let's create a detailed blueprint:
Agent Architecture
1. Data Layer

Profile Database: JSON structure storing user's professional information
Document Repository: Storage for parsed resume, cover letters, certificates
Mapping Engine: Rules and patterns for field identification across platforms

2. Platform Detection Module

Fingerprinting of common application platforms (Workday, Taleo, Greenhouse, etc.)
Custom detection for unknown platforms based on form element patterns
Page structure analysis to identify multi-page applications

3. Field Recognition System

DOM traversal to locate and categorize form fields
Natural language processing to understand field labels and requirements
Pattern matching for common field types (name, address, dates, etc.)

4. Data Mapping Engine

Contextual evaluation of appropriate data for each field
Confidence scoring for mapping accuracy
Fallback mechanisms for ambiguous fields

5. Form Interaction Module

Browser automation for field population
Handling of dropdowns, checkboxes, and special input types
File upload management for resumes and documents

6. User Interface

Browser extension with popup controls
Field highlighting for review
Override options for user corrections

Implementation Approach
Form Recognition Strategy

Train on dataset of common application forms
Use field label text, input types, and surrounding context
Leverage consistent patterns in form structures

Data Extraction Pipeline

Parse resume and documents using NLP
Extract structured information (work history, education, skills)
Normalize data formats (dates, phone numbers, addresses)
Create queryable knowledge base of user information

Execution Flow

User navigates to application page
Agent detects platform and form structure
Fields are identified and mapped to user data
Confidence scores determine auto-fill vs. prompting user
User reviews and approves final submission

Technical Stack

Frontend: Browser extension (JavaScript/TypeScript)
Processing: Local ML models for privacy or API-based for power
Storage: Encrypted local storage or optional cloud sync
Security: Zero-knowledge encryption for sensitive data

Development Roadmap

Basic form detection and simple field mapping
Platform-specific adapters for major job sites
Resume parsing and structured data extraction
Advanced field recognition and contextual mapping
User feedback loop and continual improvement
